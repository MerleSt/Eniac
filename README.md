# Eniac

This project analyses sales data from a company named Eniac, which mainly sells Apple products and accessories.

The data for this project can be found in the Data-Eniac folder.

In the folder Notebooks-Clean-Data you can find the files in which the tables are cleaned and formatted as to reach usable tables for further analysis.

In the Main file Eniac, the clean tables are imported and merged. Afterwards, columns for further anlysis are added and outliers are dropped.
Following, comes an analysis of the structure of the data, to get a better overview.
Lastly I analysed the orders which are completed in comparison to the ones which were still in the shopping basket.

Concluding the data are missing many identifiers such as a customer ID to identify stages of the orders and why and where they are moving. Furthermore, costs are missing entirely. With this being said, the analysis is still useful but can be imporved upon with other data.
