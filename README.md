# Eniac
This is a project in work. I will  update as I go along.

The Notebooks, brand, orders, orderlines, products clean the data provided. The original data can beaccessed in the folder Data-Eniac, while the polished, cleaned data are uploaded into the subfolder Data_Cleaned. The clean data are imported into the Eniac Notebook, which is where the analysis will happen.
